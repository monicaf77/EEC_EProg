The characters sent from the PC must be received by the UART and stored in the FIFO of the receiver. The stored data is then changed (by an incrementing circuit) and retransmitted to the PC, through the UART. A pushbutton (with a debouncing circuit) is used to control the reading and writing of data in the FIFO. \n",
