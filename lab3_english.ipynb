    " , i=1...4) but shares its data inputs with all other displays. Note that the enable input is asserted to zero, as shown in the figure. As long as the refresh rate is high enough, the human eye cannot tell that the displays are scan-driven.\n",

This scheme requires a hexadecimal-to-7-segment decoder, a 4-bit vector multiplexer, a counter, and a zero-asserted 2:4 decoder.

The simplest circuit to implement a clock divider is a counter. The LSB (bit 0) of a counter oscillates at frequency $f_{osc}$ / $2$. By analogy, bit n will oscillate at a frequency  $f_{osc}$ / $2^{n+1}$. Therefore, bit n=17 of a binary counter oscillates at a frequency of 100MHz / $2^{18}$ = 381Hz.\n",
