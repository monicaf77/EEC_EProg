As the dividend register is shifted to the left, it frees up memory space that can be used to accommodate the quotient bits. In the end, the **rl** register holds all the bits of the quotient, while the **rh** register stores the remainder of the division.\n",

    "This circuit intends to measure the frequency of a periodic input signal. The simplest way to implement a frequency meter is to use a counter that counts the number of pulses in the input signal during a predefined time (for example, 1 second). Although this solution is sufficient for a high-frequency signal, it does not allow you to accurately measure low-frequency signals. In this case, the best way would be to measure its period and then invert it to obtain the frequency. This is the solution we will implement next.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit will then have to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Measurement of signal period;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculation of frequency, performing a division operation (f=1/T);\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conversion of the result (frequency in binary representation) to BCD, for display on 7-segment displays. This operation will be performed by the module analyzed in the previous section, defined in the file **bin2bcd.vhd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the period of the input signal, we will use a counter that counts the number of clock cycles between two rising edges of this signal. Once the frequency of the clock signal is known (fclk=100MHz), the period of the input signal can be easily obtained. For example, if the circuit counts N cycles, then the period is Tsi=NxTclk and we say that the measurement resolution is Tclk=10ns. If the clock of this counter has a frequency lower than 50MHz, the resolution will necessarily be lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow diagram (ASMD) is represented in the figure below. When the **start** input is asserted, the circuit waits for the first rising edge of the input signal (**waite state**). This occurrence is signaled by the edge **signal**, generated by an edge detector circuit (discussed in Lab4). As soon as the edge is detected, the circuit resets the **p** and **t** registers and goes to the **count** state, where the temporal measurement is performed. When a second edge is detected, the circuit goes to the **done** state, where the **done_tick** signal is asserted, indicating the end of the measurement. \n",

    "Two registers are used. The **t** register counts between 0 and 99999 (100000 clock cycles) with a clock signal at 100MHz while the **p** register is only incremented when **t** reaches the end. This register (p) is therefore incremented with a signal at 100MHz/100000=1kHz, which results in a resolution of 1 millisecond. On the other hand, this is a 10-bit register, so its maximum value is 1023, which corresponds to a maximum period of 1023x1ms=1s (i.e. a minimum frequency of 1Hz). The minimum value is 1, which corresponds to a maximum period of 1ms (i.e. a maximum frequency of 1kHz).\n",
