    "A rising edge detector is a circuit that generates a pulse of one clock cycle duration (we can call it a tick) whenever it detects a transition from '0' to '1' in a given input signal. This circuit can be designed as either a Moore machine or a Mealy machine. Here, we will analyze both solutions to assess their differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state and flow diagrams of the Moore machine are shown in the following figure. The zero and one states indicate the input logic level, while the edge state indicates that a rising edge has occurred, as shown in the timing diagram.\n",

    "If we implement the circuit as a Mealy machine, there are only two states, state **zero** and state **one** , as shown in the state and flow diagrams in the Figure below. When we are in state **zero** and the input changes to '1', the output **tick** is immediately asserted. As soon as the machine stabilizes in state **one**, the output is set back to '0'. The timing diagram of this implementation is also shown in the Figure.\n",

    "Note that this machine is more compact (fewer states) and responds faster than the Moore machine. The Mealy machine responds as soon as the transition is detected, while the Moore machine only responds at t1. As disadvantages, the Mealy machine is more sensitive to disturbances (glitches) in the input signal and the pulse in the output signal does not have a predefined width. However, if the downstream circuits are synchronous with the rising edge of the same clock signal there is no problem since the pulse in the tick output is stable around this edge. As long as this condition is met, the Mealy machine is generally preferred for this application, due to its greater speed. Also in this figure, we can see the corresponding hardware implementation (a flip-flop, an AND gate and an inverter).\n",
